    "# Vector-Borne Disease Prognosis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "This dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the *Vector Borne Disease Prediction* dataset. Although the feature distribution is similar, there are differences in the feature distribution compared to the original dataset. It is permissible to use the original dataset for feature engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes two files:\n",
    "- `train.csv`: The training dataset, with the target variable `prognosis`.\n",
    "- `test.csv`: The testing dataset, with `prognosis` excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Information: \n",
    "All symptoms prognosis included in the dataset are associated with 11 vector-borne diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), vector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases and cause over 700,000 deaths annually. These diseases are transmitted through biological vectors, such as mosquitoes, flies, and ticks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Biological Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological vectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans or from animals to humans (zoonoses). The organisms infect themselves during a blood meal on an infected organism and later transmit the pathogen to a new host.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: WHO (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/vector-borne-diseases)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Symptoms\n",
    "\n",
    "The common symptoms of vector-borne diseases include fever, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, rash, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: KidsHealth (https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/mosquito-diseases.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Risk Factors to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several risk factors associated with vector-borne diseases, including climate change and human-animal interaction. Higher temperatures increase the probability of pathogen development in the environment. There are also several sociodemographic factors that increase the risk of contracting vector-borne diseases, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poverty and inequality: People living in poor conditions are more vulnerable to vector-borne diseases, as they may lack access to health and sanitation services, adequate housing, and vector control services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Globalization and urbanization: People who own pets and exotic animals are at higher risk of contracting vector-borne diseases. Urbanization can also affect the transmission of vector-borne diseases in crowded cities or streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Human and animal interaction: Activities such as hunting, farming, and pet ownership can increase the risk of contracting vector-borne diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It is recommended to adopt a cautious approach while dealing with these diseases and take necessary preventive measures to avoid transmission.\n",

    "In conclusion, the analysis indicates that the models are not performing well and are likely guessing rather than making informed decisions based on the data. To improve their accuracy, I recommend exploring more relevant feature combinations that can enhance the model's ability to capture the underlying patterns in the data. Additionally, we can experiment with different modeling techniques and algorithms to identify the most suitable approach for the data at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further steps could involve collecting more data in the same format (like the original dataset) to improve the quality and diversity of the dataset, conducting a more thorough feature engineering process, and implementing cross-validation techniques to assess the models' robustness. It is important to note that the effectiveness of the proposed steps may vary depending on the nature of the data and the problem we are trying to solve.\n",
